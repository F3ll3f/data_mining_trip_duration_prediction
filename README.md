# data_mining_trip_duration_prediction

Eleftherios Bolkas

This is a project made for a Data Mining course in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the duration of a trip provided by a taxi/ridesharing company. The project consists of two parts. In the first part, I analyze the data, calculate various stats and create diagrams in order make conclusions about the dataset. The second part starts with the clustering of the pickup points of the trips using the K-Means algorithm. After, that I train a Random Forest Regressor Model(after finding the best hyperparameters) and evaluate it.

The Python Notebook(trip_duration_prediction.ipynb file) contains the whole project, including presentation of the project and detailed explanation of its implementation(in greek). The notebook is already run on a dataset of trips by 2 companies in New York and all the data analysis and the results of the predictions and the clustering are presented in the notebook.
